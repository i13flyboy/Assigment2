# CP1404 Assignment 2: Travel Tracker 2.0 by Kyle Kunz

Python Assignment 2 using GUI kivy 

# Project Reflection 

## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
Assignment 2 has been interesting at the least. its taking quite a while to finish and there is still so much room for 
improvements. This assignment is definitely harder than i thought i would be.   

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
I thought the classes were really good and how they make coding easier to read and understand. They make the code look 
really neat and tidy and is able to be used in other programs  

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
I wish we had more freedom to create and design our own projects rather than following a strict criteria. I also think 
that working in pairs would be grate as you  get to make more fiends and help each other when you are stuck. 

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
Going though all the help sessions and taking time to understand how this assignment is meant to work. as well as 
going through the pracs and using them to help with the project. 

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
It would be much better that I understand everything completely in the lectures and pracs before I try to do
the assignments. starting sooner would have defiantly been for beneficial, however due to having 2 other assignments
at the same time did not help at all, I felt so flustered. 

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
The video help sessions was by far the best learning resource that i used. This is because i could go scroll back the 
video if i didn't understand a certain part of the assignment.The lecture notes were also important to figure out how to code some things to
do with classes.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
I would say one of the main challenges for this assignment was to learn how to the classes worked and how to get Kivy 
working on my own PC. In my assignment i struggled with the load_places and how to get the places.csv to load but after
while i got it to work.The names for all the different parts of classes were a bit hard to wrap my head around but after
watching the help sessions i finally got.    

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
Made code look neater and easier to find specific parts as well as improved my coding experience and making it more 
efficient.However i still need to go back through some videos to fully understand the class names and where the they 
need to go.
